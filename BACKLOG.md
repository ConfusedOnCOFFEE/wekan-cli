# TODO

- Fix table view.
- Labels for card update doesn't work. Somehow the parsing panics or my derive is bad.
- If an artifact is created, the age of the store should be removed or atleast make it in a way, that the new artifact can be found.
- emacs integration.
- Remove store feature and always disable it.
- Find a way to E2E without extra build set.
- Configure different build setups.
- Rust Tests.
